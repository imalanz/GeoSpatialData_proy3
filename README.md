# RockAI studio.
RockAI is a music, web company that applys the Artificial intelligence with the music industry.

As their Data Analyst I had the job to find the company a place for their new offices, it has to be where the influence of the samae business and a place where the technology and the future is happening.


## Exploration.
Had to get all the needs that the company need it, about the company itself and the people working there. Had to check some special demands:
- It needs to be around other companies, or startups that are in the same category, so they could suport each other and feel in the same mood.
- Its a company of young people working there, they are really active and pasion for what they are doing, music and tech.
- The CEO loves coffe, specially starbucks.
- Music environment around the city or specialy around the office.
- Some of the employess have kids, that would not have to be a problem.
