# RockAI studio.
RockAI is a music, web company that applys the Artificial intelligence with the music industry.

As their Data Analyst I had the job to find the company a place for their new offices, it has to be where the influence of the samae business and a place where the technology and the future is happening.


## Exploration.
Had to get all the needs that the company need it, about the company itself and the people working there. Had to check some special demands:
- It needs to be around other companies, or startups that are in the same category, so they could suport each other and feel in the same mood.
- Its a company of young people working there, they are really active and pasion for what they are doing, music and tech.
- The CEO loves coffe, specially starbucks.
- Music environment around the city or specialy around the office.
- Some of the employess have kids, that would not have to be a problem.

### About the city.
Started looking for companies within the same field, where they where ubicated, and for far away most of the companies within the music field where in the US, and for the city that was different.
It was between San francisco and New York, I wanted something different, not the place where all the companies goes, and how the city structure is, in San francisco, everything is far away, need to take the car everywhere not in NY. Also saw that theres a lot of music environment and a lot of big companies there.

Start seen where the big companies where install in manhathan, and put my focus on that, its low town.
